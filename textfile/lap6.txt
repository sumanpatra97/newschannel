The GeForce RTX 2060 which is found in a wide range of gaming laptops was previously limited to 90W of power, with most manufacturers choosing the default 80W for their notebooks. With the 2020 GeForce refresh, Nvidia is increasing that limit to 115W, which can bring more performance out of the same GPU as long as a proper cooling design is used.eason for this could be that Nvidia realized the RTX 2060 was not very compelling when limited at 80W. On average, the RTX 2060 at 80W performs on par to the GTX 1660 Ti which is supposed to be a notch below the base RTX. As seen on the graph below, in a best case scenario like Control, the RTX 2060 is just 5 timesfaster, but in a worst case, the GTX 1660 Ti can be up to 6times faster.
The average buyer may not realize this, while RTX 2060 laptops usually command a higher price tag (100 to 200 more), performance between those two GPUs is too close to call at the same wattage. With the RTX 2060 you do get access to features like ray tracing and the Tensor cores (for DLSS).Xiaomi sub-brand Redmi has announced a new gaming laptop called Redmi G in its home market - China.
