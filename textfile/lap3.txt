Second-screen laptops are the cool tech gadgets du jour, but so far, we havenot seen a good reason to pay extra for one, given all the compromises. However, ASUS made a good case when it unveiled the futuristic ROG Zephyrus Duo 15. As well as a sleek design, it has top-flight specs and a high-resolution second display that tilts up for better cooling and visibility. 
The Duo 15 looks stunning. It is more refined and powerful than previous ASUS dual-display laptops and that might tempt early adopters who want to both impress their friends and still beat them at Far Cry 5. On the downside, it is also heavier and more expensive than a normal 15-inch laptop. Now, let us find out if it can go beyond that initial  wow factor and justify its 3,000 starting price. 
Design-wise, the ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 is one of the few laptops that really gave me buyer lust. The second screen, which ASUS calls the ROG ScreenPad Plus, pops up via a hinge mechanism to a 13-degree or so angle when you flip the lid open. The tilt makes it easier to see and use, while also exposing fan intakes. ASUS said that increases airflow by 30 percent, improving performance and reducing noise. On a hot day, however, the fans still cranked to borderline annoying levels while I was playing Shadow of the Tomb Raider.
